# IsMartinRunning

This is the public repository for our tweeting hamster cage project.

Every time our hamster (Martin) runs on hs wheel, a photo is taken and is tweeted with a message about how far he ran.

It also can respond to tweets @IsMartinRunning giving information about the temperature/humidity of his cage, as well as being able to remotely dispense treats for him.

Instructions for the project can be found at [http://www.instructables.com/id/Tweeting-hamster-cage/]
